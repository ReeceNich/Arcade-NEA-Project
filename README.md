# Quiz Game - A-Level NEA

## Outline
This goal for this project is to produce a collection of mini-games which students can use as a revision/learning tool for school subjects.
The mini-games will be 2D and orientated around learning, whilst at the same time aiming to give the students an interactive and fun way to engage in learning.
